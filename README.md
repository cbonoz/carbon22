### Concept



### TODO:
* Add ability to multi-select region locations on map
* Allow user to specify 'load' duration for the forecast API.
* Based on selected locations make an api call to the sdk to determine the best forecast.
* Suggest regions to run the load if the user didn't select a region with great carbon emissions.
* Add chart visualization with the best time range highlighted on the chart for the user in an easy to read format.


### Future work

* Expand to other cloud service platforms (GCP, AWS, DigitalOcean, etc.)
* More dynamic recomendations based on job to be done.
